# KLox

A kotlin implementation of Lox language from [Crafting Interpreters tutorial](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

Here below the features I implemented, the missing ones given from that the tutorial and some extra ones I'll implement just for fun.

Tutorial features:
- [x] basic operations (+,-,*,/,%,**,and,or,not,^)
- [x] variable declaration
- [x] if-then-else statement
- [x] while loop statement
- [x] for loop statement
- [x] function declaration
- [ ] class declaration
- [ ] inheritance
- [ ] bytecode virtual machine 

Extra features:
- [ ] write the Lox typing rules and implement a type checker 
- [ ] null-safe operator
- [ ] convert lox programs in Three-Address-Code (3AC)
- [ ] use LLVM as one of the possible backends
